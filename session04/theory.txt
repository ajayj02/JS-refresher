async function always return a promise.
from an async function we return either a promise or it will wrap the value returned inside the promise.

let say we have declared a promise outside and we return it through an async function then it will not wrap
it inside another promise it will return our promise P as it is from the async function.


** Async await

await can only be used inside async function.
await makes the syntax more neat.
